      <!--<p><u>WHAT IS ROCK CLIMBING?</u> - Rock climbing by definition is the self-explanatory act of climbing a rock face.</p>
      
      <p><u>TELL ME MORE!</u> - In reality, its a multi-faceted sport that can be done both solo or with others.
        There are certain equipment requirements that come into play depending on the type of climbing; as well as the difficulty a climber engages in. Feel free to browse
        the various sections of this site to answer all your climbing questions!</p>!-->



<footer><!--WARNING: Climbing is inherently dangerous. Serious injury and death have occured throughout its history. Please act responsibly and understand that <u>EVERYBODY</u>
  is liable for <u>THEIR OWN</u> actions. Lucy is certainly not liable for your stupidity... &#x1f49c;!-->
